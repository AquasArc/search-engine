	/*
	 * Think about: 
	 * 
	 * Why does processQuery belong here and not in the inverted index?
	 * - The stemming logic
	 * - We want to keep the inverted index general. 
	 * - The inverted index will still work even if we don't stem words
	 * - Its just an extra step of pre-processing that we are doing
	 * - So we want to keep the data structure nice and general
	 * - Inverted Index data structure can store stem words, non-stem words, even
	 * 	 phrases like n-grams
	 * - We want the data structure as general as possible
	 * - This is specific how we are doing the processing. Like how we want to do
	 *   stemming first.
	 * - Which will help us improve our search results later.
	 * - We keep processing step/cleaning step outside of the data structure, 
	 *   so that the data structure cares only about the storing logic...
	 *   
	 * Why does searchExact belong in the inverted index and not here?
	 * - This is based on how the data is stored
	 * - While processQuery stays inside the QueryProcessor because its main
	 *   functionality is just to stem, parse, clean, etc
	 * - searchExact and searchPartial needs to stay inside the inverted index because
	 *   their functionality more leans to how information is stored...

	/*
	 * Why are you using 2 data structures for search?
	 * 
	 * TreeMap and a List that both store the same FileResult objects
	 * 
	 * This was terrible coding on my part, and too wasteful/redundant. My 
	 * Original thought was having a TreeMap that would store the FileResults objects
	 * While removing duplicates and placing them in alphabetical order
	 * And same for the key sets as well
	 * 
	 * Then id use the values for the List to write the results. I thought it would be
	 * more straightforward/easier to do
	 * 
	 * But how id improve upon this:
	 * Change the return type of search (partial and exact) to a list<FileResults>
	 * -  This will remove the unnecessary usage of a Tree<String> that holds location during search
